# Question:

Create three variables, to which you will subscribe
The three variables should stream a set of random numbers between 1-10000, in random order at an interval of 0.5 sec till 30 secs
Subscribe to the three variables and generate an array then sort(ascending) it. (expected output sorted array of length 60 )
Subscribe to the variables and generate three arrays one for each stream, and sort the arrays. Then merge sort the three arrays to make one big array
compare outputs.
